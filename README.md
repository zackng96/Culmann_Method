# Culmann_Method
 Calculation and visualisation of Coulomb active/passive earth pressure based on Culmann's graphical solution

## Purpose
 Visualisation of Coulomb earth pressure for retained soils of uneven, idealised geometry using Culmann's graphical approach for education purposes.

## Input
 Inputs required from the user are mainly section geometry, soil parameters including friction angle.

## Output
 Yields maximum active earth pressure/minimum passive earth pressure as well as visualisation of Culmann graphs.

## Future Development
1. Display line load in output
2. ~~Generalisation of slope geometry using a series of piecewise connections~~
